pyramid_layout changelog
========================

0.6 (2012-12-26)
----------------

- Fixed bug where class panels couldn't have args.

- Added error handling for the case where a BeforeRender event is not preceded
  by a ContextFound event.  This can happen in the case where an error occurs
  before a context is found and then a renderer is called by an error handler,
  as would be the case using pyramid_debugtoolbar.  In this case there will be
  no layout_manager, since the layout manager depends on the context.

- Removed Sphinx as an installation dependency.  It is still required by the 
  'docs' extra.

0.5 (2012-10-23)
----------------

- Added a layout predicate to allow selection of a named layout declaratively
  when using Pyramid >= 1.4.

----------------

- Changed name from pyramid_bottlecap to pyramid_layout.

0.3 (2012-04-19)
